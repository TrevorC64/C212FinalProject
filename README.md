## How to use?
Simply get the scr and run in eclipse or another IDE you use
Run the AirlineSystemDriver first (Don't run AirlineDriver or customerDriver first)
There is no data permanence in the program
Follow the Menus and follow directions
Some users are prewritten as tests so you can interact with those if you want
the flights are printed in one long line, so you will have scroll left and right for reliven data like airlineNames
