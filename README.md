- It doesn't have data permanence(sarcasm)

## Installation
Use github destop to hook the src to your IDE, then run it.

## Tests
All tests were done in main functions (User Input Required).

## How to use?
1. Install
2. Navigate to AirlineSystemDriver and run
3. Follow the Menus and follow directions

Notes:
 - There is no data permanence in the program
 - Some users are prewritten as tests so you can interact with those if you want
 - The flights are printed in one long line, so you will have scroll left and right for reliven data like airlineNames
